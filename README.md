# ECE-477-Embedded

Hello and welcome to the code used during the different stages of our project Prototyping Dabble. To find the corresponding code for the different stages navigate to one of the available directories, then into the src folder. Main.c will be the bulk of the code with the accompanying code found in src.c as well. Below is a block diagram that shows the connectivity of our microcontroller to the other peripherals, as well as a youtube video that shows the functionality of the final project.
